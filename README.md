# Movie-Watchlist

* Created a Web App that allows users to search for any movie and add it to their watchlist. Also implemented a ‘watched’ section for movies already watched by the user.
* Used modern technologies like **React Hooks, React Router, Context API, Local Storage and TMDB (The Movie DataBase) API** for fetching movie details.
