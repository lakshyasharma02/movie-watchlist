# Movie-Watchlist

* A Web App that allows users to search for any movie and add it to their watchlist. Also implemented a ‘watched’ section for movies already watched by the user.
* Modern technologies like **React Hooks, React Router, Context API, Local Storage and TMDB (The Movie DataBase) API** for fetching movie details have been used.
